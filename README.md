# CipherSafe

**CipherSafe** is a robust and user-friendly password management tool that emphasizes top-tier digital security. Designed to protect your sensitive information, CipherSafe combines advanced encryption technologies with an intuitive interface, making it a powerful choice for secure password management.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Encryption**: Utilizes AES-256 for password encryption and RSA for encrypting AES keys.
- **Secure Password Hashing**: Employs SHA-256 hashing for the master password.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Includes features like random password generation, password visibility toggling, and clipboard operations.

## How It Works

CipherSafe integrates multiple layers of security:
1. **Encryption**: Passwords are encrypted using AES-256, and the encryption key is itself encrypted with RSA.
2. **Hashing**: Master passwords are hashed using SHA-256.
3. **Password Management**: Users can add, view, and manage passwords securely.

## Security Considerations

- **Secure Environment**: Ensure that the `SECURE_ENV` environment variable is set to `true` for optimal security.
- **Regular Updates**: Stay informed about updates to maintain the highest security standards.
